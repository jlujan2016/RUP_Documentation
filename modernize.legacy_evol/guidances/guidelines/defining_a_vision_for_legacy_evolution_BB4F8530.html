    <a id="Assessing_Value" name="Assessing_Value">Assessing the Value of a Legacy System</a>
</h3>
<p>
    As stated in <a class="elementLinkWithUserText" href="./../../../modernize.legacy_evol/guidances/concepts/legacy_evolution_CDF2C18F.html" guid="7.179899387270789E-307">Concept: Legacy Evolution</a>, when we talk about legacy systems, we suppose two things:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        The system is large and old.
    </li>
    <li>
        The system original development was not done with the RUP.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    This last point usually means that the development work products, when they exist, do not carry the usual RUP names or
    are not in the form we expect them in the RUP. Very often, they are just missing or obsolete or so old that nobody can
    trust them to still be relevant to the system. We can assume that other techniques were used: the design was not done
    using object-oriented technology, the requirements did not employ use cases, and so on.
</p>
<p>
    We also assume that the legacy system represents a significant asset (a "legacy") that is really worth reusing in some
    form or another as opposed to scrapping it altogether. So the value of the current asset must be assessed: Is its value
    in the code? The design? The requirements? Some of the algorithms or data? Or just the market share that the product
    commands? Unfortunately, the older the system, the harder it is to grasp and use the existing assets. The software
    documentation is very often obsolete, and the design must be reverse engineered (i.e., it requires "design recovery"),
    sometimes from the code itself.
</p>
<p>
    Having to deal with a legacy system is usually considered a negative, but the existence of a "precedent" system to
    establish a point of comparison and use as a source of information is, in fact, very valuable. Unprecedented systems
    are much harder and riskier to define and develop.
</p>
<p>
    In particular, your legacy system will enable you to easily identify:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Requirements and business rules
    </li>
    <li>
        What is architecturally significant
    </li>
    <li>
        Primary use cases
    </li>
    <li>
        Users' priorities, wishes, and behaviors<br />
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    The only danger is that the legacy system can be an anchor, stifling the examination and consideration of fresher
    approaches.
</p>
<p>
    Once you have assessed the value of your legacy system, you can define an approach for evolving it.
</p>
<h3>
    <a id="Approaches_Evolving_Legacy" name="Approaches_Evolving_Legacy">Approaches for Evolving a Legacy System</a>
</h3>
<p>
    There is a broad range of evolutionary changes that we might want to undertake, from simple functionality extension to
    a radical architectural change, to complete redesign and reimplementation. For each, different technical solutions and
    levels of process formality will apply. Here are examples of legacy system evolutions:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <a href="#Extension">Extension</a>
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="#Cosmetic">Cosmetic makeover</a>
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="#Migration">Migration</a>
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="#Redevelopment">Redevelopment</a>
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="#Integration">Integration</a>
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="#All">"All of the above"</a><br />
    </li>
</ul>
<h4>
    <a id="Extension" name="Extension"></a>Extension
</h4>
<p>
    In simple cases, you just need to add some functionality or feature. Drivers, such as regulation changes, emerging
    business needs, or new features made available by the competition, require a corresponding evolution of the existing
    system. With many legacy systems, the older they are, the more difficult even simple additions become. The cumulative
    effect of years of extension leads to a degradation of the system's architectural integrity, thus increasing the
    difficulty of extending that system.
</p>
<h4>
    <a id="Cosmetic" name="Cosmetic"></a>Cosmetic makeover
</h4>
<p>
    Often you do not need to scrap the whole system, but only to give it a new look or perhaps take advantage of a new user
    interface or inter-system interface technology. A solution based on wrapping certain components of your system to give
    them a new interface or allow their reimplementation can lead to an acceptable result with minimal development. This is
    the case for many applications that need to be rapidly "Web-enabled," for example.
</p>
<h4>
    <a id="Migration" name="Migration"></a>Migration
</h4>
<p>
    The system may have exceeded the useful life of its underlying hardware, operating system, or middleware. It relies on
    technologies that are either no longer maintained or are very costly to keep alive. The solution is to migrate the
    legacy system to a new platform (hardware or software), preserving much of the existing software. For example, an
    application developed for a DEC VAX VMS environment must rapidly be deployed on a wide range of Unix- and Linux-based
    platforms. This was the case when we migrated the Rational Environment (a product with two million lines of code) from
    our own proprietary platform to a range of Unix-based platforms, which led to the product known today as Rational Apex.
    Whereas extension means adding new domain-specific behavior, migration means adapting the legacy system to a different
    technology platform. Migration has less tangible domain-specific value, but failing to do it in a timely and efficient
    way can lead to serious consequences.
</p>
<h4>
    <a id="Redevelopment" name="Redevelopment"></a>Redevelopment
</h4>
<p>
    If the legacy system is a mission-critical system that has become extremely hard to evolve, that cannot scale up, and
    that relies on obsolete hardware or software technologies, then you may have to redevelop it. Usually, you have to do
    this gradually as you cannot afford to lose your existing customer base. This was the case for the Canadian Automated
    Air Traffic System, which was running on very old hardware and an operating system more than twenty years old. You may
    object that this option does not belong here; but even if you plan to rebuild a system from scratch, you should exploit
    your legacy system to understand key aspects of the new system. It contains a wealth of both positive and negative
    experience and knowledge.
</p>
<h4>
    <a id="Integration" name="Integration"></a>Integration
</h4>
<p>
    Because redeveloping a legacy system from scratch is not a financially viable option for many large companies, they
    usually prefer to develop new features using new technologies and integrating these new applications with their legacy
    system. This approach, called Enterprise Application Integration (EAI), enables them to move to new technologies while
    leveraging existing legacy assets. For more on this approach, see <a class="elementLinkWithUserText" href="./../../../modernize.legacy_evol/guidances/concepts/enterprise_application_integration_3CEC2399.html" guid="3.047769946860121E-305">Concept: Enterprise Application Integration (EAI)</a> and <a class="elementLinkWithUserText" href="./../../../modernize.legacy_evol/guidances/guidelines/integrating_legacy_applications_into_modern_584F495E.html" guid="2.4617992790518683E-308">Technique: Integrating Legacy Applications Into Modern Architectures.</a>
</p>
<h4>
    <a id="All" name="All"></a>"All of the above"
</h4>
<p>
    Finally, there are circumstances under which a company may need to do a migration, cosmetic makeover, and redevelopment
    or integration in succession. They may need to rapidly move a legacy system to a new platform and give the system a
    brand new look to satisfy market demands, then redesign the system and gradually replace the old code base,
    chunk-by-chunk, using new technology -- software components, new language, and middleware -- in order to be able to
    move forward. This is the most challenging and risky approach, but it can be done.
</p>
<p>
    For example, a company with a large MIS application containing several million lines of RPG (Report Program Generator)
    code developed on an IBM AS/400 platform had to convert this code to Java and be capable of running it on the Web and a
    wide range of Windows and Unix systems. They successfully redesigned and implemented the application in Java over a
    period of two to three years with only minor disruption to users.
</p>
<h3>
    <a id="Evaluating_Business_Case" name="Evaluating_Business_Case">Evaluating the Business Case</a>
</h3>
<p>
    The Vision needs to reflect an approach that makes good business sense. You do not evolve a legacy system just because
    it is there. In general, it really is reasonable to keep legacy systems around: their development or acquisition is
    typically a sunk cost, and most likely there is no business justification for scrapping them. However, resources spent
    maintaining a legacy system could alternatively be spent on new opportunities. If you find that you are simply engaging
    in preservation -- injecting resources into a system for emotional or historical reasons rather than for meaningful
    business reasons or because you have not examined any alternatives -- then it is probably time to examine the business
    case.
</p>
<p>
    A good business case needs to take in account the short term and long term impacts of the various alternatives, from
    retaining the legacy system as is to the various options for evolution. The recommendations of the business case should
    balance the short-term tactical business objectives and long-term strategic objectives of the organization.<br />
