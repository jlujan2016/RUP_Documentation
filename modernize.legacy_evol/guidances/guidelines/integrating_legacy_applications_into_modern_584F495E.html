</h3>
<p>
    The mission-critical systems, frequently called "legacy systems," of many large companies are often buried within
    large, monolithic applications with no industry-standard interfaces and developed with older computer languages, such
    as COBOL. Many of these companies wish to exploit internet, intranet, e-commerce, and other new technologies in order
    to remain competitive. However, rewriting these key "legacy systems" may not be a viable option from a financial (too
    expensive) or technical (initial programmers no more in the company) or timing (can't afford to wait) point of view.
    The alternative chosen by many companies is to modernize their "legacy systems" by integrating them with new
    applications.
</p>
<p>
    The most popular way to make such integration is commonly called <a class="elementLinkWithUserText" href="./../../../modernize.legacy_evol/guidances/concepts/enterprise_application_integration_3CEC2399.html" guid="3.047769946860121E-305">Enterprise Application Integration or EAI</a> and consists in implementing a
    communication infrastructure between the various enterprise applications, both new and legacy.
</p>
<h3>
    <a id="Legacy_Integration_Strategy" name="Legacy_Integration_Strategy"></a>Legacy Integration Strategies
</h3>
<p>
    Legacy integration can be divided into two main categories :
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <a href="#Non_invasive">Non-invasive</a>
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="#Invasive">Invasive</a>
    </li>
</ul>
<h4>
    <a id="Non_invasive" name="Non_invasive">Non-invasive</a>
</h4>
<p>
    Non-invasive strategies are those that don't modify the legacy application or perform only minor modifications. This
    strategy is the less expensive one but is also the less flexible. This approach is usually used when EAI integration is
    done at <a class="elementLinkWithUserText" href="./../../../modernize.legacy_evol/guidances/concepts/enterprise_application_integration_3CEC2399.html#User_Interface_Level" guid="3.047769946860121E-305">user interface level</a>, at <a class="elementLinkWithUserText" href="./../../../modernize.legacy_evol/guidances/concepts/enterprise_application_integration_3CEC2399.html#Data_Level" guid="3.047769946860121E-305">data level</a>, or sometimes at <a class="elementLinkWithUserText" href="./../../../modernize.legacy_evol/guidances/concepts/enterprise_application_integration_3CEC2399.html#Application_Interface_Level" guid="3.047769946860121E-305">application interface level</a>.
</p>
<p>
    When integration is done at the user interface level, the existing text-based screens are replaced by browser-based
    ones integrated in an enterprise business portal. Even if this kind of integration is usually considered somewhat
    unstable and archaic, it is sometimes the most practical way to integrate legacy systems that do not provide database-
    or business process-level access.
</p>
<p>
    Data level integration can be done by either reusing the existing legacy database or by extracting the data from the
    existing database and updating a new database using an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) solution. Even if this approach
    seems attractive, it is sometimes difficult to implement because data transformation, constraints, and controls are
    often implemented in the business logic of the legacy applications.
</p>
<p>
    Non-invasive application interface-level integration, called also "legacy wrapping," can offer a little more
    flexibility. In this approach, you build callable Application Programming Interfaces (API) around legacy transactions.
    Since this approach leverages existing legacy transactions, it is not very expensive and avoids the inconveniences of
    data-level integration. By transforming the transactions in APIs, it gives more flexibility than user-level
    integration. However, to remain non-invasive, this approach cannot be used to modify and enhance business features. For
    that, you need to use an invasive approach.
</p>
<h4>
    <a id="Invasive" name="Invasive">Invasive</a>
</h4>
<p>
    An invasive strategy supposes that you need to modify functional legacy code. Obviously, there is more risk and cost
    with this kind of approach because usually legacy code is old, not well documented, and the programmers who wrote it
    are rarely available. But this type of approach is also the one that gives more flexibility and allows you to modify
    and enhance existing business processes and features. This approach is usually used with EAI <a class="elementLinkWithUserText" href="./../../../modernize.legacy_evol/guidances/concepts/enterprise_application_integration_3CEC2399.html#Application_Interface_Level" guid="3.047769946860121E-305">application interface level</a> integration when you need APIs that do not correspond to
    existing legacy transactions. This approach could be also used with EAI <a class="elementLinkWithUserText" href="./../../../modernize.legacy_evol/guidances/concepts/enterprise_application_integration_3CEC2399.html#Method_Level" guid="3.047769946860121E-305">method-level</a> integration, but refactoring the existing code to provide sharable
    methods is often too expensive.
</p>
<p>
    One invasive application interface level integration approach is called "legacy e-Components." This approach consists
    of partitioning the legacy application into a collection of autonomous business components. Each component publishes a
    clearly defined set of APIs that facilitates the move from rigid program-to-program connectivity toward a more loosely
    connected message-based approach that can be deployed in multiple platforms and integrated into the overall
    architecture using appropriate component models. This approach can be refined to define each "legacy e-Component" as
    one or more services in a Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA), using XML web services. See <a class="elementLinkWithUserText" href="./../../../modernize.legacy_evol/guidances/concepts/service-oriented_architecture_92BDF995.html" guid="1.0245783036914358E-305">Concept: Introduction to Service-Oriented Architecture</a>.
</p>
<p>
    Because invasive approaches are typically more expensive and architecturally risky than non-invasive approaches, you
    should consider adopting an iterative approach that drives down risks and proves architecture feasibility in the early
    iterations.
